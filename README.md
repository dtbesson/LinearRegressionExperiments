# LinearRegressionExperiments

This was a quick project completed in a laboratory session at university. We used the babies.txt and email.Rdata files to practise some key skills:
- Creating simple and multiple linear regression models
- Plotting regression relationships
- Creating jitterplots and boxplots
- Removing outliers
- Running diagnostics on our models
